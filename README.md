Hey, I'm <a href="gitub.com/Owtter">@Owtter</a>. Nice to meet you!
<br>
<hr>
<strong>TL:DR:</strong>
<br>
Interests: Maths, data science, mashine learning and web development.
<br>
Languages (in decreasing order of comfort): Python, HTML, CSS, Java, C#, Java Script
<br>
<hr>
While I've got great interest in anything computer science related, whether that's hard- or software, I'm currently 
diving into data science as well as back- and frontend web development.
My other CS fields of interest are mainly mashine learning or hardware oriented. Though I'm capable of programming 
in Java, C# and Java Script, the language I'm most capable in and enjoy most certainly is Python.
